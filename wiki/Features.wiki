#summary All features of the script.

= Features =
  * All countdown clocks show full time on hover (xx days, xx hours, xx minutes, xx seconds)
  * Build and Research pages show you the time until you can do the next upgrade (if it doesn't know the mine level, it assumes 20 for all and shows that)
  * For some things like storehouse and mines, it shows you what the next limit will be
  * Shows on build page when storehouse will be full (assuming storehouse can still be upgraded)
  * Training page: shows total duration of all orders
  * Training page: shows needed resources to train xx units, and tells you how long you have to wait until you have those resources (assuming mines level 20)
  * Island details page: adds a button to the Calculator page to easily calculate the distance to that island
  * List page: adds a row with totals
  * Harbour: in the transport/attack section: shows you how much your ships can carry
  * Your alliance page (Members section): at the bottom of the page, you'll find a list of all members, in groups of 50 names, for easy mass mailing
  * Events page: adds a button "Delete" at the top of the page; also checks new events "Transport to you" automatically
  * On page of an island reached from Map: new buttons "On map" (goes to map), and "Calculate distance" (links to Calculator page with details filled in)
  * Harbour page: you can paste island coordinates in the form xx:yy:zz in the first box (with ctrl-v), the data will be split automatically over the other boxes
  * Next to "Sign Out" link, a "Help" link has been added
  * On the laboratory page, a silly typo of Sven has been fixed
  * Several pages of buildings show the cost to upgrade them to other levels, if upgrading is still possible (resources, storehouse, stone wall, watch-tower)
  * Map page shows more info: who is in the visible section, their alliance, in a mailable list format, with the number of islands in the alliance. Rulerless islands, if any, are noted too
  * Added buttons on harbour/barracks/lab page for entering unit amounts:
    * 'max' enters the max units you can build/train of this type with your current resources,
    * 'day' enters the amount you can build per day, or the max with your current resources, whichever is lowest
    * '+1', '+5' add 1 or 5 to the current amount
    * 'X' resets the form to 0 units
  * On mail pages, when a match for xx:yy:zz is found, a link is created instead, for easy viewing.
  * Added a button to the harbour page called "Fleetsave". It enters all ship amounts in the box, goes to island 1:1:1 (or if one is already entered by you, it uses that one), and Attacks. Then on the presend-attack page, it enters the right unit amounts automatically to save as many archers as possible, then spears, then stonies, and cats too of course.
  * Clicking "Spy" button on harbour page automatically adds 1 sws if no lws and no sws # is entered. If no sws available, adds 1 lws.
